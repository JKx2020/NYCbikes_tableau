# NYCbikes_tableau

This project is an analysis of bike riding data from the NYC CitiBike database for winter, spring, and summer. The goal was to show how ridership changed with the seasons using a variety of Tableau graphs, dashboards, and a storyboard. Before the data could be analyzed however, it needed to be cleaned and set-up. This repository shows the work done in Python before the visualizations in Tableau. 

<strong>Tools/Languages used:<strong> Python, Pandas, Tableau Designer, Tableau Public
